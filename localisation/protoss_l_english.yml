Although they excel in physical combat, High Templar prefer to use psionic attacks that they have developed through intensive training. The Protoss have such powerful psionic abilities that their presence inadvertently disrupts other life-forms. With careful guidance, High Templar can learn to augment this effect, creating storms of raw psionic energy that can tear apart the minds of lesser species. "
 collossi_army: "Collossi"
 collossi_army_desc: "The towering Colossus is a Protoss robot design dating back to the bloody conflicts of the Kalath Intercession. It strides across the battlefield on four tall, slender legs that allow it to cross steep elevations with ease. The Colossus' heavily armored hull carries two powerful Thermal Lances, with one on each side of its body. The robot's beam attack cuts a broad swath across its targets, making the Colossus an ideal anti-infantry weapon. Unlike most other Protoss robots, the Colossus was created purely for destruction. Manufacturing Colossi has been outlawed for centuries, but the increasingly desperate war against the Zerg has forced the Protoss to revive the line. "

 hatchery: "Hatchery"
 hatchery_desc: "Hatcheries perform three vital functions that no colony can survive without producing the creep, which most zerg structures require in order to be built, giving birth to larvae that can mutate into the various zerg breeds and digesting minerals and vespene gas to change into a nutrient form that zerg can use to feed their mutations. In addition, the hatchery is one of the only structures that can be built without pre-existing creep (the other being the extractor) and is therefore essential for any expansion attempt."
 nydus_network: "Nydus Network"

 extractor_desc: "The zerg extractor is essentially a giant organ that sits atop a vespene geyser and packages the vespene gas into small fleshy sacs that can be easily carried by zerg drones to a nearby hatchery for absorption. Through this structure, the zerg convert raw vespene into a form that is more beneficial for their organic systems. The refined gas it produces becomes a necessity in the later evolutions of the zerg breeds. As the extractor lives off gas itself, it does not need to be built on an area already covered in creep."

 creep_tumor_desc: "The creep tumor is a structure which extends the creep. It resembles a cluster of boils protruding from the creep. "
 overlord: "Overlord"
